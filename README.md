# TipTheTable
A little calculator I made for my dad to calculate the force required to tip a table. Useful for woodworkers or table tipping hobbyists.

Allows you to input tabletop and base lengths and weights. Inputs can be any unit as long as they are all consistent. Ouput is in the same unit as the input weight.

I don't do frontend so be happy there is one at all :) 

Tested to be accurate within a few pounds
